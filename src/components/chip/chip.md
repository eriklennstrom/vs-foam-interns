Chips are compact elements that represent an input, attribute, or action. 

Chips allow users to enter information, make selections, filter content, or trigger actions.

## Usage

If the chip is used to emit a function. 

For example filter a list, all you need to do is to add the function to the Chip component

```html
<foam-chip variant="static" text="Filter price" @click="filterPriceFunction" />
```

## Static

In sets that contain at least two options, static chips represent a selection.

## Selectable

## Removable

Removable chips can be used to remove a filter setting.
